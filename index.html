                        I'm sure you've figured this out already,
                        but my name is Caleb Schmidt.
                        I'm 18 years old and live in Moncks Corner, SC.
                        I graduated high school in the summer of 2022,
                        and am now enrolled in a coding bootcamp known as <em>Coding Temple</em>.
                        I grew up in northern Indiana for most of my life,
                        and have just recently move to South Carolina in the last 3 years.
                        It's the school I went to here however, 
                        that made me realize my love for software development, 
                        and it's because of that school that I'm now enrolled in <em>Coding Temple</em>.

                    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                    <p>
                        I pick up new hobbies fairly frequently, 
                        the most recent being baking.
                        One of my favorite hobbies is sports though.
                        Football, Basketball, Baseball, Bowling, Volleyball, 
                        Badminton, you name it, I loved playing it all.
                        Another Favorite hobby of mine is playing games with friends and family.
                        It hardly matters what game it is, I enjoy the time I spend with them 
                        just as much as the game we're playing, if not more.

                    <h2>Why Programming?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Programming has always been an interest of mine 
                        ever since my Dad became a programmer in 2011.
                        It was something that, to this day, he really 
                        passionate about, and my interest in it developed 
                        through that exposure. I've always enjoyed problem solving 
                        and the challenge that programming brought to me, 
                        and no matter what I was working on, I found appreciation 
                        in getting one step closer to the finished product, 
                        no matter how small that step was. Programming lit a fire 
                        inme that I never knew I had, and it only makes me 
                        want to pursue it more. 
                    </p>
